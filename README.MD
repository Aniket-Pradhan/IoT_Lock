These are the project files of the SLOCK (Smart Lock), made for our Introduction to Engineering Design Final Project.

We plan to use this along with a DC 12v solenoid lock assembly.

The parts list for the SLOCK are:
1. NodeMCU WiFi module.
2. TIP120/TIP122 transistor.
3. DC 12v solenoid door lock assembly.
4. IN4001 diode.
5. 12V DC supply.
6. RFID Card Reader for Arduino.
7. NFC Stickers.

A diagram is attached for the circuit. (replace the bulb with the lock).
